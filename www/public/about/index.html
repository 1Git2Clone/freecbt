        <h1>What's quirk?</h1>
        <p>
          Quirk is a company created to help more folks get access to Cognitive
          Behavioral Therapy. Our app is
          <a href="/open-source">open-source</a> on Github and is designed to be
          simple and easy to use.
        </p>
        <p>
          We see Quirk as a "front-door" to professional help. Many people
          neglect seeking a therapist or psychiatrist because they don't feel
          their problem is "big enough" or they're not aware just how effective
          CBT can be.
        </p>
        <h2>Contact</h2>
        <p>
          If you need to reach the creators of Quirk for any reason, just
          <a href="mailto:contact@quirk.fyi">send us an email.</a>
        </p>
        <h2>Privacy &amp; Data Collection</h2>
        <p>
          Quirk treats your thoughts as the most <em>sensitive</em> possible
          data, because it <em>is</em> your most sensitive possible data.
        </p>
        <p>
          So like rational people:
          <strong>we do not record or store your thoughts.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          We don't want to know your thoughts. When you record something in
          Quirk, it lives on your phone, not on some server in Ohio or
          something. In the future, we may create a cloud-sync feature. If we do
          this, your thoughts will be
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client-side_encryption"
            >client-side encrypted</a
          >. They'll be encrypted on your phone and <em>then</em> sent to us, so
          no one at Quirk will ever be able to read your thoughts.
        </p>
        <h3>Data we <em>do</em> record</h3>
        <p>
          As much as we'd like to know as little as possible about you, we have
          to make a few compromises to keep the lights on. But we'd rather be as
          explicit about what we're doing as possible, so you can make an
          informed decision to trust us or not.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Error logs</strong> If Quirk has a bug, we want to know about
          it ASAP. If we don't, it can cause real harm, like corrupting your
          data. To avoid this, we collect logs from your phone that include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The IP address of your phone</li>
          <li>The type of phone that the error happened to. (ex: iPhone XS)</li>
          <li>
            Some "hints" we've left in the code that help us figure out what
            just happened.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This information is shared with Sentry, a bug-tracking third party
          tool that we trust.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Behavioral Data</strong> In order to create a product that's
          actually useful for people, we collect anonymous, event-based,
          behavioral data. That means when you do something in the app like
          follow up on a prediction, we get sent a message that looks like this:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>User 15412315 followed up on a prediction</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Nearly every tech product behavioral analytics, but Quirk specifically
          only uses <em>anonymous</em> behavioral analytics.
        </p>
        <p>
          By <em>anonymous</em>, we mean we don't connect this to any personally
          identifiable information. In other words, we don't know that "George
          Freedman in Ohio" followed up on a prediction, just that
          <em>someone</em> followed up on a prediction.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we could, we'd avoid anonymous analytics. But we've compromised
          here for two reasons.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first is that our error logs are not good enough on their own to
          alert us of bugs. For example, if a bug disables an entire feature, we
          may not get any error logs since no one is able to access the feature.
          But if the number of people recording predictions drops to 0, then
          it's likely that it's broken.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second is that we must build something that people actually want
          and use. That means that if we release a new feature and it isn't
          being used or it's somehow disliked, we'll just remove it. We're not
          in the business of creating a bloated product, we're in the business
          of making something that helps you feel better.
        </p>
        <h2>Who makes this?</h2>
        <p>
          Quirk is developed by
          <a href="https://twitter.com/evanjconrad">Evan Conrad (me)</a>, who
          codes, draws the cute quirk bubbles, and is generally worried about
          everything and
          <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kobyconrad/"
            >Koby Conrad (my brother)</a
          >, who does the marketing and business stuff, and is generally
          optimistic and calm about everything.
        </p>
        <p>
          Quirk originally started as a tool Evan made to help with his panic
          attacks. It's still that, but now it helps all sorts of folks.

          family.

        <h2>Other Projects</h2>
        <p>
          We don't really think about Quirk as a journaling product. But if you
          <em>want</em> a journaling product, we actually do have one:
          <a href="https://nightly.quirk.fyi/">Nightly, a daily journal</a>.
          It's free, immensely private, and youdon't need to make an account;
          just start writing and it automagically saves your work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Be warned, it's just a small thing Evan hacked together. Evan uses it
          as his nightly journal, so it works just fine, but it's not the focus
          of the company.
