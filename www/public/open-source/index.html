        <h1>What does open source mean?</h1>
        <p>
          FreeCBT is <em>FOSS (Open Source)</em>. That means that the code that
          powers the application is open and available to look at for free. If
          you'd like to look,
          <a href="https://github.com/erosson/freecbt">it lives here.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, here's the code that does the "Catastrophizing"
          explanation:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-jsx" metastring="">const Catastrophizing = () =&gt; (
  &lt;Distortion&gt;
    &lt;SubHeader&gt;
      {i18n.t('catastrophizing')} {'ðŸ¤¯'}
    &lt;/SubHeader&gt;

    &lt;Paragraph&gt;{i18n.t('catastrophizing_explanation')}&lt;/Paragraph&gt;

    &lt;ThoughtView color="purple"&gt;
      {i18n.t('catastrophizing_thought')}
    &lt;/ThoughtView&gt;
  &lt;/Distortion&gt;
)
</code></pre>
        <h2>FOSS means you can contribute</h2>
        <p>
          If you want to help, FreeCBT accepts new contributions. Want a new
          feature? Found a typo? Think something should be different? You can
          propose a code change at any time. We'll take a look at it.
        </p>
        <h2>FOSS means you can disagree</h2>
        <p>
          If you don't like something about FreeCBT and you've got the technical
          know-how, you can "fork" (copy) the project and then redistribute it.
          If you do this, we'd ask you give your new version a different name so
          people don't get confused.
        </p>
        <h2>FOSS means you can audit</h2>
        <p>
          If you think FreeCBT is doing something dangerous or otherwise don't
          trust us, you're free to look for yourself. With a medical app, this
          is pretty important.
        </p>
        <h2>FOSS means you can learn</h2>
        <p>
          FreeCBT is an up-to-date example of how a real software project is
          built. If you're interested in how to program something like FreeCBT,
          you're free to look at how we did something and then do it the same
          way. Remeber, we're not geniuses and we may not do everything the
          best.
        </p>
        <h2>FOSS means FreeCBT can live on</h2>
        <p>
          <a href="https://github.com/flaque/quirk"
            >Quirk, FreeCBT's predecessor</a
          >, is sadly no longer maintained. For a non-open-source app, the loss
          of the company maintaining it is the end. However, because Quirk was
          open-source, a new maintainer stepped up and resurrected Quirk as
          FreeCBT! If FreeCBT's maintainer is ever unable to keep the app going,
          another maintainer can once again step up and keep your favorite CBT
          app alive.
