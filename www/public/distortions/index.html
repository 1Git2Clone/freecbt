            <p>
              If we downplay the good things that are happening to us, we're
              minimizing the positive. Even if our day didn't go 100% as
              planned, it doesn't mean that the 60% that did go right should be
              ignored.

            <p>
              If a bad situation must be the fault of someone else, we're
              other-blaming. If you failed an exam and you're blaming the
              teacher, you're directing your energy to the wrong place. Someone
              cut you off on the highway? If you honk your horn, flip them off,
              and stew, how is that helping? Now you're cut off and mad!
            </p>
            <p>
              This doesn't mean you have to blame yourself for every negative
              situation. You don't have to blame anyone. No one has to be at
              fault if you let the situation pass without attaching blame.

              If we draw conclusions based on just one example, we're
              over-generalizing. If you bombed a presentation and assume that
              means you're "bad" at presenting, you're over-generalizing.
